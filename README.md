# Hemingnay
An extremely bad fanfiction generator.

### How to make it work

The backend needs to be ad-hoc hosted on Google Colab. Follow the steps:

* Go to https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iwhsz4oUsY479KrUmYw6UZmjzOTRzBR2?usp=sharing
* Ensure that Colab is using a GPU (Edit -> Notebook Settings)
* Run all the cells
* Copy the ngrok.io url from the output of the last cell
* Go to https://hemingnay.netlify.app
* Paste the ngrok.io url
* Type something in the input (or donâ€™t)
* Press generate and wait a few seconds
